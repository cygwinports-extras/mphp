ldesc: "PHP4Mono is a compiler that enables Mono to run PHP code. It 
translates PHP scripts to Common Intermediate Language (CIL). Like that 
PHP scripts can be executed as console applications on Mono. You can 
even access other .NET assemblies and e.g. build Graphical User 
Interfaces directly from within a PHP script using the Gnome libraries."
